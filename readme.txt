1. Payment Gateway design considerations
    
    1.1. Architecture and tech stack
    
    I'd like to implement Payment Gateway as REST API and to use JSON format. I'd also like to implement it 
    using .NET Core and to host it on Azure. I assume it is acceptable.
    
    1.2. Endpoints

    According to requirements, Payment Gateway 
            -   should provide merchants a way to process a payment 
            -   should also allow a merchant to retrieve details of previously made payment using its identifier. 
      
    A standard way to implement these requirements in REST API is to treat each payment as a separate resource with a unique URL. 
    The URL should include resource type (payment) and its identifier. Example:  {paymentGatewayBaseUrl}/payments/{paymentIdentifier}
    When API receives GET request to resource's URL, it will return the resource representation in JSON format. 
    Clients can create new payment resources by sending POST requests to {paymentGatewayBaseUrl}/payments.
    Payment details are passed in POST request body.

    1.3. Data store

    In order to meet requirements to allow a merchant to retrieve payment details, Payment Gateway needs to store payment details 
    in a persistent data store. Data store should support saving payment details and retrieving payment details by identifier.
    It can be done by using a relational database or a NoSQL store. NoSQL store (in particular a document database) could be 
    a good choice for these requirements, especially in case there is no other requirements for data joining and querying. 
    Relational database is also a good choice. I have decided to use a relational database (SQL Server) because I have more 
    experience with SQL Server than with NoSQL databases.

    1.4. Status codes
    
    According to the requirements, a merchant should be able to process a payment and receive either a successful or unsuccessful response. 
    Details of a previously made payment should include a status code which indicates the result of the payment.
    
    REST APIs return HTTP status code to indicate if an operation was successful. For example, Payment Gateway will use 200 to show that an operation
    was successful, 422 to indicate that validation has failed and 500 for an internal server error.
    
    Unfortunately, it is possible that not every payment failure scenario has a corresponding HTTP status code.
    In case a payment has failed, Payment Gateway will assign its own status code and return it to the merchant in the response body.
    It will also store the status code in the data store together with payment details. 

    in case the payment failure has happened in the Acquiring Bank and it returns its own error code, it is a good idea to add this
    information to payment details. However, the Payment Gateway will not store bank's error code directly. Instead, its own 
    list of status codes should have values which correspond to bank error codes. Payment Gateway will map bank's error code to these 
    status codes. This is done to protect Payment Gateway and its clients from unexpected code changes in Acquiring Bank.

    1.6. Encryption

    Data at rest 

    According to the requirements, the response should include a masked card number and card details. 
    Current version of Payment Gateway stores the masked card number and does not store the complete card number.
    This is not production-ready. PCI-DSS should be taken into consideration.
    In particular, card details should be encrypted according to the appropriate security standards.
    As an alternatiive it could be possible to use a secure 3rd party service to store the credit card details.

    Data in transit

    Current versions of Payment Gateway enforces HTTPS (by using app.UseHttpsRedirection command) in order ensure that card details 
    are not transmitted between Merchant and Payment Gateway unencrypted. It should also use HTTPS when calling Acquiring Bank.

    1.7. Payment identifier

    Payment identifier generated by the Acquiring Bank is not always available. It is possible that the Acquring Bank system throws an exception
    and returns an error message, which does not contain payment identifier. 
    Payment Gateway should generate its own payment identifier, return it to the merchant and use this identifier in GET payment endpoint URL.
    Since payment identifier is exposed to external systems, it is practical to use GUID data type. 
    
    Identifier returned by the bank can be stored as an optional property of payment resource. It can be useful for incident investigation purposes. 
    

2. Scenarios for the payment processing endpoint

    2.1. Happy path

        Merchant 
            submits a request to the payment gateway
        Payment gateway 
            validates the request 
            saves the request in its data store
            forwards payment request to the acquiring bank
        Acquiring bank 
            validates the request
            processes the payment 
            returns 200
        Payment gateway 
            saves the response in its data store
            returns 200 to the merchant

    This scenario is implemented as a component test and an integration test.

    2.2. Validation failure in Payment Gateway

        Merchant 
            submits a request to the payment gateway
        Payment gateway 
            validates the request, validation fails 
            returns 4xx to the merchant

    I have made an assumption that invalid requests should not be stored in data store.
    This scenario is implemented as an integration test.

    2.3. Validation failure in Bank

        Merchant 
            submits a request to the payment gateway
        Payment gateway 
            validates the request 
            saves the request in its data store
            forwards payment request to the acquiring bank
        Acquiring bank 
            validates the request, validation fails
            does not process the payment 
            returns 4xx
        Payment gateway 
            saves the response in its data store
            returns 4xx to the merchant

    This scenario is implemented as an integration test.

    2.4. Server error in Bank

        Merchant 
            submits a request to the payment gateway
        Payment gateway 
            validates the request 
            saves the request in its data store
            forwards payment request to the acquiring bank
        Acquiring bank 
            validates the request
            tries to process the payment but fails
            returns 5xx
        Payment gateway 
            saves the response in its data store
            returns 5xx to the merchant

    This scenario is implemented as an integration test.

    2.5. Server error in Bank, non-JSON response

        Merchant 
            submits a request to the payment gateway
        Payment gateway 
            validates the request 
            saves the request in its data store
            forwards payment request to the acquiring bank
        Acquiring bank 
            returns 5xx with non-JSON response
        Payment gateway 
            saves error details (empty payment identifier and error code) in its data store
            returns 5xx to the merchant

    This scenario shows that payment identifier generated by the bank is not always available.
    This scenario is not implemented as part of this exercise, but a production system should be ready for this scenario.

    2.6. Bank timeout

    Same as scenario above but bank does not respond
    This scenario is  implemented as part of this exercise, but a production system should be ready for this scenario.

    2.7. Database exception before calling bank

        Merchant 
            submits a request to the payment gateway
        Payment gateway 
            tries to saves the request in its data store
            data store returns exception
            returns 500 to the merchant

    This scenario is implemented as a component test.

    2.8. Database exception after calling bank

        Merchant 
            submits a request to the payment gateway
        Payment gateway 
            validates the request 
            saves the request in its data store
            forwards payment request to the acquiring bank
        Acquiring bank 
            validates the request
            processes the payment 
            returns 200
        Payment gateway 
            tries to saves the response in its data store
            data store returns an exception
            returns 200 to the merchant

    This scenario is implemented as a component test

    It is unclear what status code should Payment Gateway return to the merchant if the Bank processed the payment but data store returned an error.
    It depends on whether it is safe to re-send payment request to Bank endpoint.
    I have made an assumption that Bank endpoint is not idempotent and it is not safe to re-send payment request to Bank.
    In this case Payment Gateway should catch the exception from DB and return 200 to the merchant to ensure the merchant 
    does not retry the same payment.
    As a result of that, merchant will have correct response code but Payment Gateway data store will have incorrect status (because update failed)
    Payment Gateway should ideally notify the support team (eg by raising an alert) to ensure support team fixes the issue.
    It is also possible to make DB update asyncronous by using message queue. That will ensure DB will be correctly automatically updated at some point.


        
3. Scenarios for the retrieving payment details endpoint

    3.1. Happy path

        Merchant 
            submits a request to the payment gateway
        Payment gateway 
            retrieves the payment details from its data store
            returns 200 and the payment details to the merchant

    This scenario is implemented as an integration test.

    3.2. Incorrect payment id

        Merchant 
            submits a request with incorrect payment id to the payment gateway
        Payment gateway 
            tries to retrieves the payment details from its data store but does not find it
            returns 404 to the merchant

    This scenario is implemented as an integration test.

    3.3. Database exception

        Merchant 
            submits a request to the payment gateway
        Payment gateway 
            tries to retrieves the payment details from its data store 
            data store returns an exception
            returns 500 to the merchant
        
    If the data store returns an exception, Payment Gateway should retry several times. 
    It can help resolve errors related to intermittent connectivity issues and make this scenario less likely.

    This scenario is not implemented as part of this exercise, but a production system should be ready for this scenario.


4. Bank Simulator

    4.1 Assumptions

    Acquiring bank exposes an REST API which 
        - uses JSON format
        - returns 200 and payment identifier for successful requests, 
        - returns 4xx, payment identifier and error code for requests which failed validation
        - returns 5xx, payment identifier and error code when payment is not possible because of technical issues (eg one of dependencies is down)
        - returns 5xx and non-JSON response when it experiences serious issues (eg whole system is down and proxy returned 503/504) 

    If the acquiring bank endpoint used a different technology (eg a SOAP web service), Payment Gateway would be able to support that 
    but code changes would be required.
